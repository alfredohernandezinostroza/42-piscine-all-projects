# piscine-all-projects
All my projects from the piscine. These correspond to the files that were uploaded and evaluated on the vlogosphere, so they could be different from the ones on my github. For example, my c07 submission is empty, and I never sumbitted c09, but I did some work and it's available in their respective github repositories.
